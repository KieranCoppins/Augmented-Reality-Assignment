# Augmented Reality Assignment
My assignment for my Augmented Reality module at University created in Unity3D. This AR mobile application was designed to re-enact famous battle scenarios. The systems created inside this project made it possible to create multiple battle scenarios that contain events that are called on a button press, this could be moving agents to a new waypoint, creating or destroying text, and custom functions.
